    <h3>Explain step by step how the tower was built.</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>      Given a image containing cubes on the ground,
                  and another image with the same cubes stacked upon each other, 
                  explain how the tower was built step by step.
        </li>
        <li>      Use references to avoid repetitions, such as "it", "the other cubes", 
                  or even spatial references such as "the leftest cube".
        </li>
        <li>      Only ONE cube can be moved at the same time.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>You must take the violet cube and move it on top of the red cube.
       Thereafter, you grasp the cube at the right side of the scene 
       and you leave it on top of the two first cubes.
       Finally, you take the indigo cube and you place it on top of the other cubes.

    <h3>Response</h3>
    <p>Move the red cube on top of the orange one. Then move both cubes on top of last cube.

    <h3>Why is it wrong?</h3>
    <p>Two cubes are moved at the same time.</p>
